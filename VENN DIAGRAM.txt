Progression:

   - Gradual increase in intensity, volume, or frequency of exercise over time.
   - A systematic and consistent approach to training that ensures continued improvement.
   - The concept of adaptation, where the body responds to the demands placed upon it by increasing its ability to perform the task.

Overload:

   - The principle of increasing the demands placed on the body in order to stimulate adaptation and progress.
   - Involves challenging the body with exercises that are progressively more difficult or require greater effort.
   - The body will only improve if it is forced to work harder than it is used to, and overload provides the stimulus for this to occur.

Overlap:

   - Both concepts are essential for achieving optimal results in exercise.
   - Overload is necessary to stimulate progress, but progression ensures that this progress is sustained over time.
   - Without progression, the body will eventually adapt to the demands placed upon it and further progress will be limited.
